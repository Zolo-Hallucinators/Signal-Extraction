# Signal-Extraction
Extracting trading signals from market &amp; news data with real-time backtesting, powered by Snowflake.

## Problem Statement:
Create a system that ingests real-time financial market data and unstructured news articles, extracts key signals, and runs a backtesting engine to validate trading strategies.

- Ingest structured data (intraday stock prices) and unstructured text (news)
- Use Snowflake Cortex for NLP and sentiment analysis
- Create feature sets for signal generation
- Implement a backtesting framework in Snowpark
- Provide explainability by linking signals to their originating events (e.g., article or pattern)

## Solution Overview:
This repository provides a modular and scalable solution for extracting trading signals from financial market data and news articles. The system is built using Snowflake's data platform, leveraging Snowpark for data processing and Snowflake Cortex for machine learning tasks.

## Key Components:
1. **Data Ingestion**:
    - Real-time ingestion of structured financial market data (e.g., intraday stock prices).
    - Ingestion of unstructured news articles from RSS feeds or APIs.

2. **Signal Extraction**:
    - Sentiment analysis and NLP on news articles using Snowflake Cortex.
    - Feature engineering to create signal datasets for trading strategies.

3. **Backtesting Framework**:
    - A Snowpark-based backtesting engine to validate trading strategies.
    - Historical data replay to evaluate signal performance.

4. **Explainability**:
    - Linking trading signals to their originating events (e.g., specific news articles or market patterns).

## Getting Started:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Signal-Extraction.git
    cd Signal-Extraction
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set Up Snowflake Connection**:
    Configure your Snowflake credentials in an environment file (`.env`):
    ```
    SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=your_account
    SNOWFLAKE_USER=your_username
    SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your_password
    SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=your_database
    SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=your_warehouse
    ```

4. **Run the System**:
    - Ingest data:
      ```bash
      python data_ingestion/ingest_market_data.py
      python data_ingestion/ingest_news_data.py
      ```
    - Extract signals:
      ```bash
      python signal_extraction/sentiment_analysis.py
      python signal_extraction/feature_engineering.py
      ```
    - Backtest strategies:
      ```bash
      python backtesting/backtesting_engine.py
      ```
